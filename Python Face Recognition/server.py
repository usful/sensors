# This is a _very simple_ example of a web service that recognizes faces in uploaded images.
# Upload an image file and it will check if the image contains a picture of Barack Obama.
# The result is returned as json. For example:
#
# $ curl -F "file=@obama2.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5001
#
# Returns:
#
# {
#  "face_found_in_image": true,
#  "is_picture_of_obama": true
# }
#
# This example is based on the Flask file upload example: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fileuploads/

# NOTE: This example requires flask to be installed! You can install it with pip:
# $ pip3 install flask

import os
import face_recognition
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_image():
    # Check if a valid image file was uploaded
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            return redirect(request.url)

        file = request.files['file']

        if file.filename == '':
            return redirect(request.url)

        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            # The image file seems valid! Detect faces and return the result.
            return detect_faces_in_image(file)

    # If no valid image file was uploaded, show the file upload form:
    return '''
